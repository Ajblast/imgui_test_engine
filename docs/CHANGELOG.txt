Dear ImGui Test Engine
CHANGELOG

** For a while this is going to include only breaking changes.
** As we slowly transition toward releasing the test engine, this will become a more full fledged changelog.

2022/05/10
- TestEngine: Installation of a crash handler is now explicit and optional. Do one of the following:
    - Call ImGuiTestEngine_InstallDefaultCrashHandler() to install default crash handler.
    - Call ImGuiTestEngine_CrashHandler() from your own custom crash handler if such exists.

2022/04/08
- TestEngine: fix ItemAction() or ItemInfo() with leading **/ wildcard from not reporting any error on failure.

2022/04/07
- TestEngine: added more filtering options to ImGuiTestEngine_QueueTests() and command-line suppot.
    - "all"   : all tests, no matter what group they are in.
    - "tests" : all tests in the ImGuiTestGroup_Tests group.
    - "perfs" : all tests in the ImGuiTestGroup_Perfs group.
    - "^nav_" : all tests with name starting with "nav_".
    - "-xxxx" : no tests will be matched because query does not include any.
    - "tests,-scroll,-^nav_" : all tests that do not contain "scroll" in their name and does not start with "nav_".

2022/03/28
- TestEngine: Capture: Removed requirement to store/pass a ImGuiCaptureArgs in ctx->CaptureXXX functions.
  General tidying up of the capture API.

2022/03/23
- TestEngine: Renamed ImGuiTestEngineIO::VideoCaptureFFMPEGPath to ::VideoCaptureEncoderPath.

2022/03/15
- TestEngine: Moved the ImGuiContext* parameter from ImGuiTestEngine_CreateContext() to ImGuiTestEngine_Start().
- TestEngine: Renamed bool ImGuiTestEngineIO::RunningTest to bool ::IsRunningTests.
- TestEngine: Renamed bool ImGuiTestEngineIO::RenderWantMaxSpeed to ::IsRequestingMaxAppSpeed.

2022/02/15

  used as template by the capture tool UI, which now manages its own data correctly).
