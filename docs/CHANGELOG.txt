Dear ImGui Test Engine
CHANGELOG

** For a while this is going to include only breaking changes.
** As we slowly transition toward releasing the test engine, this will become a more full fledged changelog.

2022/03/23
- TestEngine: Renamed ImGuiTestEngineIO::VideoCaptureFFMPEGPath to ::VideoCaptureEncoderPath.

2022/03/15
- TestEngine: Moved the ImGuiContext* parameter from ImGuiTestEngine_CreateContext() to ImGuiTestEngine_Start().
- TestEngine: Renamed bool ImGuiTestEngineIO::RunningTest to bool ::IsRunningTests.
- TestEngine: Renamed bool ImGuiTestEngineIO::RenderWantMaxSpeed to ::IsRequestingMaxAppSpeed.

2022/02/15
- TestEngine: Capture: rename ImGuiCaptureArgs::InOutputFileTemplate to InOutputFile (it was only
  used as template by the capture tool UI, which now manages its own data correctly).
