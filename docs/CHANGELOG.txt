Dear ImGui Test Engine
CHANGELOG

** For a while this is going to include only breaking changes.
** As we slowly transition toward releasing the test engine, this will become a more full fledged changelog.

2022/02/15
- Test Engine: Capture: rename ImGuiCaptureArgs::InOutputFileTemplate to InOutputFile (it was only
  used as template by the capture tool UI, which now manages its own data correctly).
