CONTENTS
- Add some demo visual thing that's not too distracting (nor tooooo fascinating)
- Game view when docked should fit in parent window while respecting 16:9 ratio

BACKENDS
- Figure out how to load a texture in a cross platform manner. Should imgui_app expose this?

DPI
- Single varying DPI: reload font and style on dpi change.

DOCKING
- Dockspace over main viewport w/ transparency. Need workarea (#3035)
- Default docking setup on init.

DRAG AND DROP
- Integrate WM_DROPFILE type of drag and drop (stashes/dragdrop_from_os).

MENUS
- The MenuItem alignment system could provide a left-most slot for icons? How do we fit this in existing API?
  How would it work with non-MenuItem in menus? they would want to start after the icon position. So it's almost if we could indent by default and have icons be in the pre-indent position?
- Implement actual CTRL+X style shortcuts.

STYLE
- Resize grip is too noticeable especially with large font (use same color as button).
- Look into colorful icons. Find nice colorful icon library. How does CustomRect api would work with multi-dpi?

MISC
- Use decorated scrollbars (#3114)

IMGUI_APP
- To allow editor to start fullscreen we may need to expose monitors?
